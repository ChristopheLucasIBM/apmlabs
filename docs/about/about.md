## About the Author & Your Feedback

[Christophe Lucas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-lucas-a5abab28/) is a fan of Miles Davis who loves playing with words, images and micro structural sounds.
As a pass-time, some times, he likes to rewrite the history of the hellenistic world,
and some other times, he creates APM lab material like the one you just bravely went through.

None of these labs would have been possible without the fantastic support of (at least) the following people:
[David Boggs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-boggs-1a54518/),
[Arif Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arifsali/),
[Carlos Ferreira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/web30/),
[Paulina Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pthomas630/),
[Graeme Pexton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graeme-pexton-0b212715/),
[Heena Purohit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heenapurohit/),
