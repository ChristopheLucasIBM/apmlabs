<h1 id="ibm-maximo-asset-performance-management-apm-labs">IBM Maximo Asset Performance Management (APM) Labs</h1>
<p>Welcome to these labs which will take you step by step through an exciting story using the 
IBM Maximo Asset Performance Management (APM) solution.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asset-performance-management-apm">What is Asset Performance Management (APM) ?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/business-operations/enterprise-asset-management/asset-performance-management">Asset Performance Management (APM)</a>
and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/business-operations/enterprise-asset-management">Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)</a>
are complementary programs.
But whereas EAM enables the <em>execution</em> of the day to day asset maintenance activities like
work scheduling, planning and work order tracking, APM is designed for <em>decision support</em>, i.e.
APM uses advanced analytics and AI to help operations, maintenance leaders, reliability engineers and technicians
make better decisions around their assets' lifecycle.  </p>
<p>By enabling ... </p>
<ul>
<li>operations people to have an enterprise wide view of their fleets of assets and detect anomalies in near real-time, </li>
<li>reliability and maintenance professionals to track the real condition and health of assets and predict their failures,</li>
<li>technicians to more quickly maintain or fix assets by providing them AI-based problem diagnosis and
expert guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>... a sound use of an end-to-end APM solution can help: </p>
<ul>
<li>reduce unplanned downtime, shorten duration of outages, increase production output or decrease wasted time investigating false-positive alerts,</li>
<li>reduce fleetwide operational risk by focusing on the right assets, increase asset availability, reduce unnecessary preventive maintenance, reduce time to make capital replacement planning decisions</li>
<li>improve first time fix rate, reduce MTTR (mean time to repair), improve diagnosis accuracy and cut diagnosis time, standardize maintenance and repair processes</li>
<li>reduce failures, reduce maintenance costs, improve asset utilisation, extended life of asset, and ultimately, enable 
a shift of maintenance strategies from a calendar or preventive base to a real
condition, then predictive and prescriptive base.</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM Maximo APM is a fully integrated set of tools which is part of a yet broader 
ecosystem of IBM solutions which will help you accelerate 'Asset Optimisation' efforts. 
Those APM elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MANAGE</strong>: bh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-maximo-asset-performance-management/asset-monitor">MONITOR</a></strong>: provides enterprise scale monitoring and AI-based anomaly detection. Main capabilities include:
easily configurable dashboard (no-code widgets), 
workflow to drive ownership of issues,
auto-generation of work orders,
rapid data integration and
hierarchical data filtering and management.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-maximo-asset-performance-management/asset-health">HEALTH</a></strong>: 
provides a consolidated global view of assets, health visibility and analysis, condition based actions and
replacement planning. Main capabilities include: dashboard with cards, map view, spreadsheet view, 
fleet-wide view and health drilldown, 
health based notifications and actions,
flexible health scoring by asset type or groups, 
sensor data integration, 
job plan efficacy analysis,
refurbish / replace prioritisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-maximo-asset-performance-management/predictive-maintenance-insights">PREDICT</a></strong>:
provides the ability to build asset failure models, to 
predict failures, to 
determine factors that contribute to failure and to
score models with current sensor data. Main capabilities include:
templates provided to build 5 common predictive models, 
view pre-built visualizations for the 5 common models,
model scores contribute to the overall asset health in the HEALTH component.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The APM tools/elements that we will extensively use in the first version (December 2020) 
of these labs are <strong>MANAGE</strong>, <strong>MONITOR</strong> and <strong>HEALTH</strong>.
In future versions will add <strong>PREDICT</strong> and <strong>ASSIST</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="apm-labs-overview">APM Labs Overview</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h3>
<p>These labs were conceived with the following audience in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IBMers &amp; Business Partners</strong>: the main goal is to help you understand how the APM elements work and integrate.
If you go step-by-step through all the lab material, you will become able to create an end-to-end custom APM demo for any scenario or customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anybody interested in APM</strong>: by just scrolling through the pages of these labs, you should get a clear view
of the rich functionalities of the APM solution and how they could possibly help you on your 'Asset Optimisation' journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="lab-principles">Lab principles</h3>
<p>These labs were created with the following principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully data driven</strong>: you will start by creating simulated IoT data.
That data will be our guide and 'golden thread' throughout all the labs: in <em>Monitor</em> you will create anomalies on it, then create
advanced visualisations of it, then, in <em>Health</em> it is that same data that you will use to 
visualise the condition of your asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully Customisable</strong>: the IoT data we will use throughout these labs consists of 8 generic readings like
<code>temperature</code>, <code>pressure</code>, <code>vibration</code>, <code>speed</code> etc. For each of those, we simulate random readings in a certain range 
e.g. <code>"temperature": random(35,40)</code>.
If you wish to simulate fewer, more or other types of readings, or change the range of values for any reading - feel free !
Similarly, we decided to use a very generic naming for the <em>Asset</em>: <code>YourInitials_Asset</code>, 
i.e.<code>CL_Asset</code> for all the labs (<em>CL</em> standing for <em>Christophe Lucas</em>). 
You can of course decide to name your Asset differently, e.g. <code>Pump</code>, <code>Engine</code>, <code>Conveyor Belt</code>, <code>Compressor</code>, <code>Turbine</code> - you name it ! <br />
If you change the readings or asset name, the labs principles will remain exactly the same - 
you will just need to pay extra attention to your naming conventions and consistently substitue the names used in this material to yours ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monkey See, Monkey Do</strong>: we have really tried to make these labs as easy and failure-proof as possible. 
For each (sub)section, a clearly numbered list of <em>steps</em> is provided, and below each list, a picture
summarises shows the screens corresponding to each step - with a <code>1., 2., 3. ...</code> red number making the mapping.
Also, if the images are too small, do not hesitate to right-click and <code>open in new tab</code> on them - 
they will appear bigger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="overview-of-what-you-will-do">Overview of what you will do</h3>
<p>Each section will detail <code>0. Objectives</code>, but high-level, this is what you are going to do:</p>
<p>In the MONITOR lab, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create 3 IoT Devices of type <code>CL_Asset</code> and generate simulated IoT data for them. 
Focusing on the <code>temperature</code> reading, we will generate <em>anomalous readings</em> during a couple minutes.</li>
<li>Visualise the IoT data in Monitor and generate new <em>data items</em>.</li>
<li>Create <code>Anomaly Detection</code> functions that will spot the <em>anomalous readings</em></li>
<li>Create <code>Alerts</code> based on the anomalies detected.</li>
<li>Create a custom dashboard that will bring everything together.
<img alt="Monitor0b" src="img/monitor/Monitor-0b.png" /> &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In the MONITOR lab, you will:</p>
<h3 id="the-treasure-hunt">The Treasure Hunt ...</h3>
<p>To 'fun up' the game, we included a little treasure hunt in this material, i.e. we hid a GOLDEN NUGGET within the Labs.
When you find it, it will mean that you have progressed tremendously on your APM journey !</p>
